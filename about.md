Hi there.

This is a blog based on an idea spawned from a conversation with my late grandmother.

I’m a self motivated outside the box thinker and tinkerer, an electronic gadget and power tool enthusiast, a fan of the outdoors, an elected leader on the sports field, and a problem solver with a positive attitude. I enjoy technical problems (both hardware and software) and I’m fascinated by efficiency.  I’m always looking to build my network and find the right fit for my skill set.
