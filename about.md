<h3>this blog</h3>
The name for this blog is based on an idea spawned from a conversation with my late grandmother. The human umbrella extends above and beyond religion or religious upbringing, nationality, race, or sexual preference. The many things that divide us as humans today are irrelevant in my opinion. At the heart of it all, we’re all connected to one another in that we’re human — and that’s enough for me.

<h3>me</h3>
I’m a self motivated outside the box thinker and tinkerer, an electronic gadget and power tool enthusiast, a fan of the outdoors, an elected leader on the sports field, and a problem solver with a positive attitude. I enjoy technical problems (both hardware and software) and I’m fascinated by efficiency. I’m always looking to build my network and find the right fit for my skill set.
