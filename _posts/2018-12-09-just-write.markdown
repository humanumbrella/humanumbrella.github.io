So let's write.

So far, I have written and erased about three paragraphs. I'm not entirely sure what that means but I'll keep trying. I think my online presence is subpar relative to my skill set. Sure, I have posted some code to GitHub and publicly showing what I've done but it doesn't have nice markdown or flow - I haven't tried to pull it and run it, practically ever, and that also means that I've likely forgotten a lot of what I did in there in the first place, hah.

Today I'm going to pick at least one of those repos and pull it, run it, see if I can get things working again - and then I'll write up a blog post about it. The goal is to have something I can be proud of presenting. As proud as I am for completing the work.
