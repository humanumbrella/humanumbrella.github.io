OK cool, that seems to work now.

So, I'm using the basic terminal in Ubuntu, haven't installed anything extra. So - in my case, I wanted to add a function to my ~/.bashrc so that I can call it to make a new post instead of copy-pasting the post and changing all of the variables, especially the datetime.
