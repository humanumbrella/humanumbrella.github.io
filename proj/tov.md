<h4>2012 - Transit of Venus</h4>

Here I was tasked with getting the local university observatory capable of being a solar observatory, and then setting up a streaming website and scripts to continuously image while also manning the telescope and interacting with the thousands of people that showed up. It was a little stressful in the moment, especially when the clouds rolled in. But we were able to capture some images of the event, and even put it together and uploaded to YouTube.
