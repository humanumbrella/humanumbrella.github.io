<h4>Academia (nerdy fun stuff)</h4>
2017 - CCDSimul - This is a client/server C# project to run two distinct copies of MaximDL to interact with two astronomical CCD cameras. MaximDL supports imaging with multiple cameras on the same computer, but not at the same time. So I needed to implement something that would allow me to take images at the same time on both cameras.  CCDSimul allows two computers, each running MaximDL and having the camera installed locally to interface across the local network and synchronize imaging on the two cameras. Further, the results are output to a shared Dropbox folder on the two machines, which syncs the image files.

2016 - ManPol - A C# GUI for manual polarimetry to operate the instrument

2016 - ArduinoPolarimeter - This code is the firmware to upload onto an Arduino UNO. You will need an Adafruit motor shield board. I used this one. This software represents the brains running behind the custom Polarimeter project my dissertation was based on.

2015 - Pier Modification Project - Renovated the 10 year old concrete and rebar (earthquake-proof)

2012 - Transit of Venus - Retrofitted the 24" Morehead Telescope with a solar filter to image the sun while Venus transited. Cool!

2008 - Quadrowulf - This is a holding place for the documentation for a project I did as a senior in undergrad.

<h4>Personal (fun stuff)</h4>
2018 - Blockchain Resume - I wanted to learn more about the Bitcoin blockchain as a data structure, so I created a simplified model based on a resume. The code is complete with cpu-level 'mining' (hashing) and can match a user-specified difficulty in the hash headers of each block.

2017 - RasbPi Mirror -

2015 - Igloo - This has been a pet project for a long time, in 2015 I finally checked it off the bucket list.
