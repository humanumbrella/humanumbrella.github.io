<h4>2015 - Igloo in North Carolina</h4>

I always wanted to make an igloo, but I never realized the amount of effort required to build one. It's not an entirely complicated procedure, it just uses a large amount of snow distributed in a large number of blocks.

I suggested the idea to my girlfriend and she enthusiastically agreed that we should give it a try. I was pumped. We're married now.

It took the better part of 3 hours for us to generate enough snow blocks to complete the project and we traded roles generating blocks vs stacking blocks.

Including some photos of my dog Sagan in his online dating profile shots. The igloo lasted multiple days after the surrounding snow melted.
